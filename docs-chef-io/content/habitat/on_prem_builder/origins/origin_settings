The **Settings** pane for an origin lets you view and manage default package settings and origin secrets.

Every origin member can view the origin's settings, but only origin administrators and owners can add, update, or delete settings.

| Settings Actions | Read-Only | Member | Maintainer | Administrator | Owner |
|---------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| View settings | Y | Y | Y | Y | Y |
| Add/Update/Delete settings | N | N | N | Y | Y |
| View secrets | N | N | Y | Y | Y |
| Add/Update/Delete secrets | N | N | N | Y | Y |

## Default package settings

The **Default Package Settings** define the default visibility of a package's build artifacts (`.hart` files) in an origin:

- Public packages are visible in search results and can be used by every Chef Habitat Builder user
- Private artifacts do not appear in search results and are available only to users with origin membership

Packages can have different visibility settings from the origin to which they belong.

Every origin member can view the origin settings, but only origin administrators and owners can add, update, or delete settings.

To change the origin's default visibility settings, select the origin in Habitat Builder, then **Settings**, and select either **Public artifacts** or **Private artifacts**.

## Origin secrets

Everyone with origin membership can view origin secrets, but only origin administrators and owners can add, update, or delete settings. **Origin Secrets** are located at the bottom of the **Settings** tab (Builder > Origin > Settings > Origin Secrets) and they let you encrypt and store secrets as environment variables. Origin secrets are useful for plans that require access to protected resources at build time, such as private source-code repositories and cloud storage providers.

Origin secrets are retained by the origin and are available for any of that origin's packages. The origin secrets in your local environment are encrypted with an origin encryption key. Only Chef Habitat Builder can read encrypted origin secrets.

### Manage origin secrets with the Chef Habitat CLI

You can view the list of origin secrets and delete them in Chef Habitat Builder.
However, the primary way of interacting with origin secrets is with the Chef Habitat CLI.

#### List secrets

To list all of the secrets in an origin, use:

```hab
hab origin secret list --origin <ORIGIN>
```

#### Set origin secrets as environment variables

Add your origin secrets as environment variables in your local environment:

```bash
export HAB_ORIGIN=<ORIGIN>
export HAB_AUTH_TOKEN=<TOKEN>
hab origin secret list
```

#### Save an origin secret

To save an origin secret give the secret a name and the key value:

```hab
hab origin secret upload AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID <KEY_ID>
hab origin secret upload AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY <SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
```

The output should similar to:

```bash
$ hab origin secret upload AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID 1234567890EXAMPLE

#### Delete an origin secret

To delete an origin secret from an origin with the CLI

```hab
hab origin secret delete AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
hab origin secret delete AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```
