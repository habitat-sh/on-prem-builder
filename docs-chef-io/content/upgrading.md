## Upgrading

Currently, Chef Habitat Builder on-prem services are not set to auto-upgrade. When you wish to upgrade the services, there is a simple uninstall script you can use to stop and unload the services, and remove the services. In order to uninstall, you may do the following:

1. `cd ${SRC_ROOT}`
1. `sudo ./uninstall.sh`

Once the services are uninstalled, you may re-install them by running `./install.sh` again.

*IMPORTANT*: Running the uninstall script will *NOT* remove any user data, so you can freely uninstall and re-install the services.
